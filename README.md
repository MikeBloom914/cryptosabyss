# cryptosabyss

Cryptosabyss is a project designed to compare the price of Bitcoin with the price of a stock, etf, social media interest and sentiment, and overall web presence over many different sites.

There are two parts to this project.  One is a chart showing all the things mentioned above, and gives you the "symbol" to plug into the top of normgraph.py under symbol.  Then you can just run the normgraph.py file and see a graph with the price of bitcoin and what you chose to compare it with, over time, with normalized values to make it easier to simply look at and analyize.

Please leave a message if you would like to see something else compared and I will do my best to add it. Thanks!
